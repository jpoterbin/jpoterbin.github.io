        <h2>January 24, 2017</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Wedding is now ~2 months out. We've picked our honeymoon spot as Kauai, one of the smaller islands of Hawaii.</li>
          <li>Using the <a href="https://stronglifts.com/apps/" target="blank">5x5 App</a> for the past few months for weightlifting. Simple routine that hits all the essential exercises with just a barbell and a weight rack.</li>
          <li>Started recording weekly videos with Erin to recap highlights of the week and thoughts on random things. May make them public at some point. Right now they're for us to watch 5, 10, 15+ years from now.</li>
          <li>For the month of January I decided to try out the month's worth of recipes from <a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/" target="blank">minimalistbaker.com</a>. I've made at least a couple recipes a week that will be regulars. It's been a long time (maybe ever) that I've followed this many recipes in such a short amount of time. I like cooking as oppossed to baking because you can improvise a lot more so I was hesitant to try something like this. But, it's gotten me to buy vegetables I've never cooked with (acorn squash, shallots, leeks, beets) and make things I get at a restaurant but never tried making at home (falafel, romesco). All the recipes are vegan which has helped add variety now that I'm vegetarian.</li>
          <li>Good TV show I'm watching right now: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X9579J1" target="blank">The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</a>. Great pace, funny show, original story plot, especially for the setting of 1950s.</li>
          <li>Good Podcast I'm listening to right now: <a href"http://jockopodcast.com/" target="blank">Jocko Podcast</a>. A retired Navy Seal officer talking about life.

        <h2>September 10, 2017</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Planning our wedding!</strong> Hoping to decide on a location and date by end of September. We've checked out a couple cool locations in Austin. Now it's a matter of checking all the logistic details.</li>
        <li><strong>RoverPass:</strong> Making our app (<a href="https://www.roverpass.com" target="_blank">roverpass.com</a>) the go-to source for vacation RVers and mobile lifestyles. Currently working on building out our <a href="https://www.roverpass.com/p/campground-booking-system" target="_blank">front-desk reservation system</a> to get more campgrounds using it.</li>
        <li><strong>Learing to code:</strong> Learning frontend development (what you see on a webpage) via <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> (Built this website from their first lesson!). Hoping to begin pushing more code alongside our developers at work. Pushed my first line of code the other week with lots of hand holding.</li>
        <li><strong>Staying updated on the world:</strong> Continuing to read/listen to <a href="https://www.economist.com" target="_blank">The Economist</a> every week. Got the subscription back in December of last year. The biggest difference from it versus other news sources is its continual follow up on key events, people, and trends. It's like reading history in the making. And it's published once a week, so you get more thoughfullness and less sensationalism in stories compared to sources updated by the minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Traveled to Boston:</strong> Just got back from Boston celebrating our <a href="https://www.theknot.com/us/felicia-cohen-and-kurt-chamberlin-sep-2017" target="_blank">friends' wedding</a>. Walked the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1bIfxofOjZa2jGiSfH8WjaTotjK0&ll=42.365169033309684%2C-71.06043360000001&z=14" target="_blank">Freedom Trail</a>, checked out the <a href="https://www.mos.org/" target="blank">Boston Science Museum</a>, the <a href="https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT Robotics Museum</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park" target="_blank">Fenway Park</a>, took <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Transportation_Authority" target="_blank">the T and commuter rail</a>, and danced the night away with friends.</li>
